# Generating Terraform Code From Coralogix

Moving to an infrastructure as code based approach can be difficult. What if the environment has thousands of alerts? Lovingly handcrafted dashboards? Meticulously organized TCO rules? Similarly, if the existing Terraform schemas changed over the versions, it may proof to be a lot of work to upgrade. 

This is why this guide and the accompanying migration script exists. Here we will go over the process of how to generate Terraform configs using the migration script along with the limitations it comes with. 

## Installing the script

The script is a wrapper around [Terraform's config generator](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import/generating-configuration) with several helpful additions that require the following dependencies to be installed: 

---

1. Terraform
2. Go (1.23 or higher) 
3. Python 3
4. hcl2json from [this repository](https://github.com/tmccombs/hcl2json)

Once installed, get the migration script from [github.com/coralogix/coralogix-management-sdk](https://github.com/coralogix/coralogix-management-sdk/tree/master/tools/terraform-importer). 

## Peeking Under The Hood

The migration script provides two modes of operation, advancing an existing state or generating (migrating) existing Coralogix resources as Terraform. In this guide we are describing option nr. 2, importing resources from Coralogix:

```bash
$ ./generate_and_migrate.sh
2025-02-28 09:55:48 [INFO] Select the migration type:
2025-02-28 09:55:48 [INFO] 1) Migrate based on a folder containing terraform.tfstate
2025-02-28 09:55:48 [INFO] 2) Migrate based on a specific resource name
Enter your choice (1 or 2):
```

Selecting menu option 2 will ask for the resource and using the provided API key (see below) and cluster, create a Terraform configuration using the selected provider version, remove any empty values from the config, and finally ask to apply the config (which should result in no changes). Let's dive deep into these parts one-by-one. 

# Generating Terraform

Let's get into it: Creating Terraform config for Coralogix resources. Skip to the summary for a video version - otherwise follow along in the following steps.

## Limitations

Before starting, let's set some expectations. The script is not using any magic, so in all but the most basic cases there is some manual work required. Here is a list of limitations that are known and cannot be addressed (unfortunately):

   - **References, variables:** Generated files will always use concrete values
   - **Blocks, modules, loops:** Generated files will produce a naive view of the resources without the assisstance of control structures
   - **Unexpected backend changes:** Mismatches between what the backend returns and the provider expect can happen and are considered bugs. Please create an issue [here](https://github.com/coralogix/terraform-provider-coralogix/issues) if you encounter one.
   - **Not "listable":** Resources that don't support a list operation can't be part of the script. In this case use the regular import declarations in Terraform. 

With these in mind, it's still possible to significantly speed up transitioning to an infrastructure as code setup using the migration script. Let's start by preparing the environment.

## Preparing the Environment

Whatever operating system (WSL on Windows is recommended) you use, make sure to run the script from within the `terraform-importer` directory from the SDK repository. Then, within that environment, set the following environment variables, just like with the Terraform provider itself:

   - `CORALOGIX_API_KEY`
   - `CORALOGIX_ENV` or `CORALOGIX_DOMAIN`

!> Note that the provided API key has to have the required permissions for accessing the resources. 

Once these are set, proceed to running the script. 

## Running the Script

The script itself needs the terminal with the environment variables set up. Make sure they exist using the `env` command:

```bash
$ env | grep "CORALOGIX_"
CORALOGIX_API_KEY=cxup_ap1K3yap1K3yap1K3yap1K3yap1b5
CORALOGIX_ENV=EU2
```

Then, run the script and select "migration type 2":

```bash
$ cd tools/terraform-importer/
$ ./generate_and_migrate.sh
2025-03-03 09:32:19 [INFO] Select the migration type:
2025-03-03 09:32:19 [INFO] 1) Migrate based on a folder containing terraform.tfstate
2025-03-03 09:32:19 [INFO] 2) Migrate based on a specific resource name
Enter your choice (1 or 2): 2
```

Then, select the resource type you want to migrate. In this example we are picking `recording_rules_groups_set`, or nr 10:

```bash
2025-03-03 09:32:21 [INFO] Available resource types:
1) alert			 8) events2metrics
2) archive_logs			 9) group
3) archive_metrics		10) recording_rules_groups_set
4) archive_retentions		11) scope
5) custom_role			12) tco_policies_logs
6) dashboard			13) tco_policies_traces
7) dashboards_folder		14) webhook
#? 10
```

Once selected the script pulls all readable resources of that type. However, to output the right Terraform config, one other input is required: the version of the provider. In this example, we are using `~>2.0.0` which means that the output conforms to that provider version. Note that after generating the output, the script requires to confirm the apply step by typing `yes`, however applying is actually optional, the generated file will exist regardless:

```bash
Enter the Terraform provider version to migrate to (e.g., ~>2.0.0): ~>2.0.0

After acknowledging the terraform apply (by typing `yes`), the resulting files will be in a subdirectory named after the resource:

```bash
$ tree recording_rules_groups_set_migration/
recording_rules_groups_set_migration/
├── generated.tf
├── provider.tf
└── terraform.tfstate

1 directory, 3 files
```

The generated files looks like this (after formatting):

```bash
$ cat recording_rules_groups_set_migration/generated.tf
resource "coralogix_recording_rules_groups_set" "examplee" {
  groups = [{
    interval = 180
    limit    = 0
    name     = "Foo"
    rules = [{
      expr   = "sum(rate(ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency_seconds_count{CX_LEVEL=\"staging\",pod=~\"ts3db-live-ingester.*\"}[2m])) by (pod)"
      record = "ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency:3m"
      }, {
      expr   = "sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job)"
      record = "job:http_requests_total:sum"
    }]
    }, {
    interval = 60
    limit    = 0
    name     = "Bar"
    rules = [{
      expr   = "sum(rate(ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency_seconds_count{CX_LEVEL=\"staging\",pod=~\"ts3db-live-ingester.*\"}[2m])) by (pod)"
      record = "ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency:3m"
      }, {
      expr   = "sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job)"
      record = "job:http_requests_total:sum"
    }]
  }]
  name = "Examplee"
}
```

As a next step, the generated resource can be used within a larger Terraform context or be the starting point to build one. Regardless, it's highly recommended to see if there are some improvements and adjustments for the specifics of the platform (variables, ...) that are not covered by the tool. 

# Summary

This tool was built to ease the migration to infrastructure as code style management of Coralogix, as well as an easy path to migrating between versions. Using the built-in feature of the Terraform CLI it allows for a quick and easy migrations between versions and onboarding infrastructure as code. Additionally, this can be an easy way to use the web UI to set preferred options and let the script handle the translation into Terraform. 

To recap, here is a video showing the importing of multiple alerts:
