# Coralogix Provider

The Coralogix provider is used to interact with [Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/) resources.

The provider allows you to manage your Coralogix rules and alerts.
It needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

Terraform 0.13 and later:

```hcl
# Set provider and it's source
terraform {
  required_providers {
    coralogix = {
      source  = "coralogix/coralogix"
      version = "~> 1.0"
    }
  }
}

# Configure the Coralogix Provider
provider "coralogix" {
    api_key = ""
    url = ""
    timeout = 30
}

```

Terraform 0.12 and earlier:

```hcl
# Configure the Coralogix Provider
provider "coralogix" {
    api_key = ""
}
```
