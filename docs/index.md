# Coralogix Provider

The Coralogix provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "coralogix" {
  api_key = "<add your api key here or add env variable CORALOGIX_API_KEY>"
  env = "<add the environment you want to work at or add env variable CORALOGIX_ENV>"
}

resource "coralogix_rules_group" "my_first_rules_group" {
  name = "my first rules_group"
}
```

## Authentication
The api-key and the desired environment for using the Coralogix provider can be set in two ways:

1. Explicitly: 
```hcl
provider "coralogix" {
  api_key = "<add your api key>"
  env = "<add the environment you want to work at>"
}
```
2. Implicitly through environment variables:
```sh
$ export CORALOGIX_API_KEY="<add your api key>"
```

```sh
$ export CORALOGIX_ENV="<add the environment you want to work at>" 
```  

## Private Domains
For private domain the `domain` field or the environment variables `CORALOGIX_DOMAIN` have to be defined (instead of `env` or `CORALOGIX_ENV`).

```sh
provider "coralogix" {
  api_key = "<add your api key>"
  domain = "cx.coralogix.com"
}
```
OR

```sh
$ export CORALOGIX_DOMAIN="<add the environment you want to work at>" 
```
