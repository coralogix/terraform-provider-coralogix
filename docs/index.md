# Coralogix Provider

The Coralogix provider is used to interact with the resources supported by [Coralogix](https://coralogix.com/). The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

**Note! The Coralogix terraform registry has now been updated to v1.3.x.** The new version contains many [breaking changes](https://github.com/coralogix/terraform-provider-coralogix/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) and does not support webhooks. It should be configured by following the instructions below.

## Example Usage

```hcl
provider "coralogix" {
  api_key = "<add your api key here or add env variable CORALOGIX_API_KEY>"
  env = "<add the environment you want to work at or add env variable CORALOGIX_ENV>"
}

resource "coralogix_rules_group" "my_first_rules_group" {
  name = "my first rules_group"
}
```
