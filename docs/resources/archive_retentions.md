# coralogix_archive_retentions (Resource)

Coralogix archive-retention. For more info please review - https://coralogix.com/docs/archive-setup-grpc-api/.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "coralogix_archive_retentions" "example" {
  retentions = [
    {
    },
    {
      name = "name_2"
    },
    {
      name = "name_3"
    },
    {
      name = "name_4"
    },
  ]
}
```

**Please note** - The coralogix_archive_retentions should be used as a singleton, meaning there's no option to handle few lists of retentions at the same account. the retentions list must contain exactly 4 retentions and the first retention is the default retention and can't be renamed.
