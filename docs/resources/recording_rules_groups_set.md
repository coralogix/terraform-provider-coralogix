# coralogix_recording_rules_groups_set (Resource)

## Example Usage

### Import from yaml file
```hcl
resource "coralogix_recording_rules_groups_set" recording_rules_group {
  yaml_content = file("./rule-group-set.yaml")
}
```

### Explicitly
```hcl
resource "coralogix_recording_rules_groups_set" recording_rules_groups_set_explicit {
  name   = "Name"
  groups = [
    {
      name     = "Foo"
      interval = 180
      limit   = 100
      rules    = [
        {
          record = "ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency:3m"
          expr   = "sum(rate(ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency_seconds_count{CX_LEVEL=\"staging\",pod=~\"ts3db-live-ingester.*\"}[2m])) by (pod)"
        },
        {
          record = "job:http_requests_total:sum"
          expr   = "sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job)"
        },
      ]
    },
    {
      name     = "Bar"
      interval = 180
      limit   = 100
      rules    = [
        {
          record = "ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency:3m"
          expr   = "sum(rate(ts3db_live_ingester_write_latency_seconds_count{CX_LEVEL=\"staging\",pod=~\"ts3db-live-ingester.*\"}[2m])) by (pod)"
        },
        {
          record = "job:http_requests_total:sum"
          expr   = "sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (job)"
        },
      ]
    },

## Schema

### Optional

- `groups` (Attributes Set) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--groups))
- `name` (String)
- `yaml_content` (String)

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedatt--groups"></a>
### Nested Schema for `groups`

Required:

- `interval` (Number) How often rules in the group are evaluated (in seconds).
- `name` (String) The rule-group name. Have to be unique.
- `rules` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--groups--rules))

Optional:

- `limit` (Number) Limit the number of alerts an alerting rule and series a recording-rule can produce. 0 is no limit.

<a id="nestedatt--groups--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `groups.rules`

Required:

- `expr` (String) The PromQL expression to evaluate. Every evaluation cycle this is evaluated at the current time, and the result recorded as a new set of time series with the metric name as given by 'record'.
- `record` (String) The name of the time series to output to. Must be a valid metric name.

Optional:

- `labels` (Map of String) Labels to add or overwrite before storing the result.

## Import

```sh
terraform import coralogix_recording_rules_groups_set.example <recording-rules-groups-set-id>
```

To get the recording-rules-groups-set id run the following command and look for the id field of the recording-rules-groups-set you want to import:
```sh
grpcurl -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" -d @ ng-api-grpc.<region-domain>:443 rule_manager.groups.RuleGroupSets/List <<EOF
{
}
EOF
```
