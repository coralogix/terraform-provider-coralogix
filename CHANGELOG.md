## Release 1.3.x

BREAKING CHANGES:

#### provider

* `url` was deleted. Instead, added `env` which defines the Coralogix environment. Also, can be set by environment
  variable `CORALOGIX_ENV` instead. Can be one of the following - `[APAC1, APAC2, EUROPE1, EUROPE2, USA1]`.
* `timeout` was deleted. Will be defined by a different timeout for each resource (internally).

#### resource/rule

* The resource `rule` was deleted. Use `rule_group` with single inner `rule` instead.

#### resource/coralogix_rules_group

* `enabled` changed to `active`.
* `rule_matcher` was deleted and `severity`, `applicationName` and `subsystemName` were moved out to previous level as
  separated lists of `severities`, `applications` and `subsystems`.
* `rules` was deleted and replaced by `rule_subgroups` (every `rule-subgroup` is list of `rule`s with 'or' (||)
  operation between).
* `rules.*.group` was deleted and replaced by `rule_subgroups.*.rules`.
* `rules.*.group.*.type` was deleted. Instead, every `rule` inside `rules` (`rule_subgroups.*.rules.*`) can be one of
    - `[parse, block, json_extract, replace, extract_timestamp, remove_fields, json_stringify, extract]`.
* All the other parameters inside `rules.*.group.*` were moved to the specific rule type schemas
  inside `rule_subgroups.*.rules.*`. Any specific rule type schemas contain only its relevant fields.

#### resource/alert

* `severity` changed to `alert_severity` and can be one of the following - `[Info, Warning, Critical, Error]`.
* `type` was removed. Instead, every alert must contain exactly one of
    - `[standard, ratio, new_value, unique_count, time_relative, metric, tracing, flow]`.
* `schedule` changed to `scheduling`.
* `schedule.*.days` changed to `scheduling.*.days_enabled` and can be one of the following
    - `[Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday]`.
* `schedule.*.start` changed to `scheduling.*.start_time`.
* `schedule.*.end` changed to `scheduling.*.end_time`.
* All the other parameters inside `alert` were moved to the specific alert type schemas inside `alert`. Any specific
  alert type schemas contain only their relevant fields.
