# Coralogix Provider known issues

* Metric lucene alert - There is no validation when `arithmetic_operator_modifier` is set and `arithmetic_operator` is
  not "Percentile". This validation will be added later when we move to the new Terraform Plugin Framework.
* Action is created not hidden when `is_hidden` set to true - this bug will be fixed later. Meanwhile, it's possible to
  update `is_hidden` to true after creation.
* TCO-Policy lose tracking of terraform if they are updated externally - this bug will be fixed later.

#### TCO-Policy - _order_ can not be configured via terraform.

* Currently, there is no support in the backend side to control the order of TCO policies, beside the creation order (
  this is planned to be supported).
  In the meantime, the only way to control it via TF, is by creating the policies in the desired order - manually, or by
  adding dependency in their creation order.

  e.g -

 ```
 resource "coralogix_tco_policy" "tco_policy_1" {
    ...
    order = 1
  }

  resource "coralogix_tco_policy" "tco_policy_2" {
    ....
    order = coralogix_tco_policy.tco_policy_1.order + 1
 }
 ```
This dependency force TF to create coralogix_tco_policy_1 before tco_policy_2, otherwise there is no guaranty on the
order (because TF can apply creations in parallel).
Unfortunately, we havenâ€™t found a way to overcome this at the update stage, until there is backend support for this.

#### Events2Metrics - issue with `aggregations` updating

* terraform not tracking changes in `metric_fields.*.aggregations` - we investigate this issue.
